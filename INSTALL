Requirements:
-------------
  OCaml (reasonably recent version; I use version 4.01.0)
  OCamlgraph (reasonably recent version; I use version 1.8.3)
  One or more of the following SMT-solvers:
    yices, yices2, z3, cvc4, mathsat5
  For koat: APRON

Build instructions:
-------------------
  "make kittel" builds the termination analysis backend "kittel.native"
  "make koat" builds the complexity analysis backend "koat.native"
  "make convert" builds "convert.native" which converts Simple programs to C

  You might need to modify the KITTEL_LIBPATH and KOAT_LIBPATH lines in the
  Makefile to ensure that OCamlgraph and/or APRON is found (the
  "-I,+ocamlgraph" resp. "-I,+apron" parts).
