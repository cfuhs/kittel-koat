Requirements:
-------------
  OCaml (reasonably recent version; I use version 4.01.0)
  OCamlgraph (reasonably recent version; I use version 1.8.3)
  One or more of the following SMT-solvers:
    yices, yices2, z3, cvc4, mathsat5
  Optionally:
   * APRON:
      If you don't have APRON, set "HAVE_APRON" to "false" in the Makefile.
      This will disable invariant generation.
   * z3 ML bindings:
      If you don't have z3, set "HAVE_Z3" to "false" in the Makefile.

      To get z3 to work with kittel/koat directly, install the new ML
      bindings. At this time (z3 stable version 4.3), they are only
      available from the z3 source code repository on codeplex, in the
      "ml-ng" branch.
      To install them, check out this branch, configure z3 with
      --ml (you will need ocamlfind, ocamlidl and some other libraries
      as well, refer to the z3 documentation) and build as usual.
      "make install" should then install the files into
      /usr(/local)/lib/ocaml/$VERSION/, where VERSION corresponds to
      your OCaml version.
      You may need to add this path to the include path of your compiler,
      cf. Makefile.

Build instructions:
-------------------
  "make kittel" builds the termination analysis backend "kittel.native"
  "make koat" builds the complexity analysis backend "koat.native"
  "make convert" builds "convert.native" which converts Simple programs to C

  You might need to modify the KITTEL_LIBPATH and KOAT_LIBPATH lines in the
  Makefile to ensure that OCamlgraph and/or APRON is found (the
  "-I,+ocamlgraph" resp. "-I,+apron" parts).
